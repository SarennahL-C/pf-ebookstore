### Portfolio
I'm curating a portfolio of data science projects I've worked on or am currently working on. Some are for fun and curiosity; others came from a data science bootcamp.

# SQL
Before my bootcamp, SQL was in my consciousness as something important for databases and an important coding skill. What I didn't expect was its elegance, which really appealed to my mathematical sensibilities over 20 years after graduation... I really enjoyed the logic, designing the structure of databases and putting together the puzzle of an efficient query.

# ebookstore
This SQLite project was a bootcamp task to:

> ... create a program for a bookstore. The program should allow the clerk to enter data about new books into the database, update book information, delete books from the database, and search to check the availability of books.

The reviewer's feedback on my project especially highlighted my detailed treatment of the missing age values and the comprehensive nature of my work. View a screenshot of the feedback [here](https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-titanic/blob/43051997789de3818f7b4399fa02fa4345319dc0/Titanic%20feedback.jpg).

This project showcases SQL coding using SQLite within Python. At this point, it was the most complex piece of Python I'd written, and it remains my longest .py file.
